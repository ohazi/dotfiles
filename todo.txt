tmux:
    ~window, tab navigation
    +clipboard
        over ssh?
        xsel doesn't work on remote systems without X - add fallback?
    ~detatching / reattaching between sessions
        +join-window, join-pane, move-window etc.
            ~bindings (prefix @)
    ~colors
        better option for 256 color terminals
        figure out how to color and style tabs
    +focus-events (bug with vim?)
    ?spurious title flashing
        I don't remember what this was about...
    +status-interval (make this shorter)
    +display-time (make this longer)
    ?vim "background color erase"
        I think this just works now?
        This seems to show up in old vim (7.4). `set t_ut=` seems to fix it.
    +scrolling in man, less (+vim on woodstock (maybe related to $TERM?))
        .tmux.conf: ridiculous bind-key WheelUpPane/WheelDownPane incantation
        Here: http://sc0ty.pl/2015/12/reasonable-mouse-support-in-tmux/
    +title in vim ($TERM=tmux-256color works, screen-256color doesn't)
        .vimrc: if tmux: set title
    +title over ssh (.bashrc)
        .bashrc: check for tmux* or screen* in $TERM
    +prompt over ssh (.bashrc)
        .bashrc: check for *-256color in $TERM
    +ctrl-left/right in vim (xterm-keys)
        .vimrc: if tmux: set term=xterm-256color
    ~mouse niceties
        +e.g. drag windows around in status bar, click to create new window,
        maybe modifier+click to drag panes around?

        graceful degradation

    bug to investigate:
        vim running in one of my tmux sessions lost the ability to see the
        * and + registers for copy/paste. Couldn't figure out how to restore
        this, launching a new shell within the session and launching vim
        from scratch made them come back. Closing and opening vim in one of
        the existing shells wouldn't work. Disconnecting and reconnecting the
        tmux session didn't work. I think I had connected to this tmux session
        via ssh from my phone, so that may have broken some connection to the
        clipboard.
        Possibly similar to OS X "reattach-to-user-namespace" hack?

        if tmux: set background=dark

        +custom colorschemes?
            just use base16 (base16-seti)
            make almost-seti colorscheme for 256 color terminals
            molokai doesn't color the tab bar
