# I generally try to avoid explicitly changing the default keybindings so that
# I'm not completely up a creek when I need to use an unfamiliar machine.
# Otherwise the following is a collection of settings that I've tested and
# found useful. Some broken or less-useful ones are left commented out for
# reference.




# Prefix settings

# I don't mind C-b, but some people prefer remapping the prefix. Apparently vim
# uses C-b, but I never use this.

# Remap prefix from C-b to C-a
#unbind C-b
#set-option -g prefix C-a
#bind-key C-a send-prefix

# Restore original prefix key
#unbind C-a
#set-option -g prefix C-b
#bind-key C-b send-prefix




# Terminal settings

# Use color terminal (tmux > 2.1)
# This seems to break mouse support when using some older versions of vim. It's
# not enough for our system to have a new, properly configured vim, any machine
# that we might ssh into also needs to have a newer vim, as this property is
# inherited as the $TERM variable over ssh.
set-option -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"

# Use color terminal (tmux < 2.1)
#set-option -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# Use 24-bit color (tmux > 2.2)
set-option -ga terminal-overrides ",xterm*:Tc"

# Fix PgUp/PgDn scrolling
# This breaks scrollwheel scrolling in programs like less/man when mouse mode
# is off (strangely, scrollwheel scrolling doesn't seem to work at all when
# mouse mode is on).
#
# Disable use of the "alternate screen" so I can use the terminal's scrollback
set-option -ga terminal-overrides ",xterm*:smcup@:rmcup@"
#
# This is supposed to do something similar, but I haven't figured out how it
# works.
#set-option -g alternate-screen off

# Use xterm-style function key sequences. This breaks programs that are not
# expecting xterm-style function key sequences, and can be particularly nasty
# when using tmux* or screen* as your $TERM, since many of programs that *do*
# accept xterm-style function key sequences reasonably only expect them when
# your $TERM is xterm*. Sigh.
#
# I usually just change $TERM whenever I encounter this and can't easily modify
# the program to check $TERM for screen or tmux, but it's sort of a pain, and
# there's probably a better way to do it.
set-option -g xterm-keys on




# Mouse settings

# Enable mouse (tmux > 2.1)
set-option -gq mouse on

# Enable mouse (tmux < 2.1)
#set-window-option -gq mode-mouse on
#set-option -gq mouse-select-window on
